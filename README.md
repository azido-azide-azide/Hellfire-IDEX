Project page for my bedslinge IDEX 3d printer

After a long time of procrastination and spinning the cad model around i can finally state that the printer is done.... mostly.
The only non final part is the xy probe for toolhead alignment.

print volume:

dual toolhead use:  290mm x 310mm x 350mm

single toolhead use: 300mm x 310mm x 300mm

Toolhead:

The toolhead(s) of the printer 

Based on Chirpys Yavoth, slimmed it down so that the maximum width is 54.5mm, changed the hotend mount to bambu, attachment to the X- axis carrige and other minor stuff.

The original printer was a Sidewinder X1, hence the new name paying homage to the printers roots.
